# Set progeny test as phenotype

Models a progeny test of individuals in 'pop'. Returns 'pop' with a
phenotype representing the average performance of their progeny. The
phenotype is generated by mating individuals in 'pop' to randomly chosen
individuals in testPop a number of times equal to 'nMatePerInd'.

## Usage

``` r
setPhenoProgTest(
  pop,
  testPop,
  nMatePerInd = 1L,
  use = "pheno",
  h2 = NULL,
  H2 = NULL,
  varE = NULL,
  corE = NULL,
  reps = 1,
  fixEff = 1L,
  p = NULL,
  onlyPheno = FALSE,
  simParam = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- pop:

  an object of
  [`Pop-class`](https://gaynorr.github.io/AlphaSimR/reference/Pop-class.md)

- testPop:

  an object of
  [`Pop-class`](https://gaynorr.github.io/AlphaSimR/reference/Pop-class.md)

- nMatePerInd:

  number of times an individual in 'pop' is mated to an individual in
  testPop

- use:

  true genetic value (`gv`) or phenotypes (`pheno`, default)

- h2:

  a vector of desired narrow-sense heritabilities for each trait. See
  details in
  [`setPheno`](https://gaynorr.github.io/AlphaSimR/reference/setPheno.md).

- H2:

  a vector of desired broad-sense heritabilities for each trait. See
  details in
  [`setPheno`](https://gaynorr.github.io/AlphaSimR/reference/setPheno.md).

- varE:

  error (co)variances for traits. See details in
  [`setPheno`](https://gaynorr.github.io/AlphaSimR/reference/setPheno.md).

- corE:

  an optional matrix for correlations between errors. See details in
  [`setPheno`](https://gaynorr.github.io/AlphaSimR/reference/setPheno.md).

- reps:

  number of replications for phenotype. See details in
  [`setPheno`](https://gaynorr.github.io/AlphaSimR/reference/setPheno.md).

- fixEff:

  fixed effect to assign to the population. Used by genomic selection
  models only.

- p:

  the p-value for the environmental covariate used by GxE traits. If
  NULL, a value is sampled at random.

- onlyPheno:

  should only the phenotype be returned, see return

- simParam:

  an object of
  [`SimParam`](https://gaynorr.github.io/AlphaSimR/reference/SimParam.md)

## Value

Returns an object of
[`Pop-class`](https://gaynorr.github.io/AlphaSimR/reference/Pop-class.md)
or a matrix if onlyPheno=TRUE

## Details

The reps parameter is for convenient representation of replicated data.
It was intended for representation of replicated yield trials in plant
breeding programs. In this case, varE is set to the plot error and reps
is set to the number plots per entry. The resulting phenotype would
reflect the mean of all replications.

## Examples

``` r
#Create founder haplotypes
founderPop = quickHaplo(nInd=10, nChr=1, segSites=10, inbred=TRUE)

#Set simulation parameters
SP = SimParam$new(founderPop)
SP$addTraitA(10)

#Create two populations of 5 individuals
pop1 = newPop(founderPop[1:5], simParam=SP)
pop2 = newPop(founderPop[6:10], simParam=SP)

#Set phenotype according to a progeny test
pop3 = setPhenoProgTest(pop1, pop2, use="gv", simParam=SP)
```
