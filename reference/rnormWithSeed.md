# Sample normal deviates using a seed

This function is designed for future expansion. The intent is to use it
to develop a GxE model based on compound symmetry. In this model, the
p-value used in the current GxE model will serve a a seed for sampling
environmental effects.

## Usage

``` r
rnormWithSeed(n, u)
```

## Arguments

- n:

  number of deviates to sample

- u:

  seed
