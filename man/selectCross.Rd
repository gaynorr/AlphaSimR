\usage{
selectCross(pop, nInd = NULL, nFemale = NULL, nMale = NULL, trait = 1,
  selectTop = TRUE, use = "pheno", nCrosses, nProgeny = 1,
  balance = TRUE, simParam = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}}}

\item{nInd}{the number of individuals to select. These individuals 
are selected without regards to gender and it supercedes values 
for nFemale and nMale. Thus if the simulation uses gender, it is 
likely better to leave this value as NULL and use nFemale and nMale 
instead.}

\item{nFemale}{the number of females to select. This value is ignored 
if nInd is set.}

\item{nMale}{the number of males to select. This value is ignored 
if nInd is set.}

\item{trait}{the trait for selection. Either a number indicating 
a single trait or a function returning a vector of length nInd.}

\item{selectTop}{selects highest values if true. 
Selects lowest values if false.}

\item{use}{select on genetic values "gv", estimated
breeding values "ebv", breeding values "bv", phenotypes "pheno", 
or randomly "rand"}

\item{nCrosses}{total number of crosses to make}

\item{nProgeny}{number of progeny per cross}

\item{balance}{if using gender, this option will balance the number 
of progeny per parent}

\item{simParam}{an object of \code{\link{SimParam-class}}}

\item{...}{additional arguments if using a function for 
trait}
}
\value{
Returns an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}}
}
\description{
This is a wrapper that combines the functionalities of 
\code{\link{randCross}} and \code{\link{selectInd}}. The 
purpose of this wrapper is to combine both selection and 
crossing in one function call that minimized the amount 
of intermediate populations created. This reduces RAM usage 
and simplifies code writing. Note that this wrapper does not 
provide the full functionality of either function.
