\arguments{
\item{pop}{an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}} or

\item{h2}{a vector of desired narrow-sense heritabilities for
each trait. See details.}

each trait. See details.}

\item{varE}{error (co)variances for traits. See details.}

\item{reps}{number of replications for phenotype. See details.}

\item{fixEff}{fixed effect to assign to the population. Used 
by genomic selection models only.}

\item{p}{the p-value for the environmental covariate 
used by GxE traits. If NULL, a value is
sampled at random.}

}
\value{
Returns an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}} or 
\code{\link{HybridPop-class}} if onlyPheno=FALSE, if 
onlyPheno=TRUE a matrix is returned
}
\description{
Sets phenotypes for all traits by adding random error 
from a multivariate normal distribution.
}
\details{
There are three arguments for setting the error variance of a 
phenotype: h2, H2, and varE. The user should only use one of these 
arguments. If the user supplies values for more than one, only one 
will be used according to order in which they are listed above.

The h2 argument allows the user to specify the error variance 
according to narrow-sense heritability. This calculation uses the
additive genetic variance and total genetic variance in the founder 
population. Thus, the heritability relates to the founder population 
and not the current population.

The H2 argument allows the user to specify the error variance 
according to broad-sense heritability. This calculation uses the
total genetic variance in the founder population. Thus, the heritability 
relates to the founder population and not the current population.

The varE argument allows the user to specify the error variance
directly. The user may supply a vector describing the error variance 
for each trait or supply a matrix that specify the covariance of 
the errors.

The reps parameter is for convenient representation of replicated data. 
It is intended to represent replicated yield trials in plant 
breeding programs. In this case, varE is set to the plot error and 
reps is set to the number of plots per entry. The resulting phenotype 
represents the entry-means.

\examples{
#Create founder haplotypes
founderPop = quickHaplo(nInd=10, nChr=1, segSites=10)

#Set simulation parameters
SP = SimParam$new(founderPop)
SP$addTraitA(10)

#Create population
pop = newPop(founderPop, simParam=SP)

#Add phenotype with error variance of 1
pop = setPheno(pop, varE=1)
