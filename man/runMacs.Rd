\usage{
runMacs(
  nInd,
  nChr = 1,
  segSites = NULL,
  inbred = FALSE,
  species = "GENERIC",
  split = NULL,
  ploidy = 2L,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{nInd}{number of individuals to simulate}

\item{nChr}{number of chromosomes to simulate}

\item{segSites}{number of segregating sites to keep per chromosome. A 
value of NULL results in all sites being retained.}

\item{inbred}{should founder individuals be inbred}

\item{species}{species history to simulate. See details.}

\item{split}{an optional historic population split in terms of generations ago.}

\item{ploidy}{ploidy level of organism}

\item{manualCommand}{user provided MaCS options. For advanced users only.}

\item{manualGenLen}{user provided genetic length. This must be supplied if using 
manualCommand. If not using manualCommand, this value will replace the predefined 
genetic length for the species. However, this the genetic length is only used by 
AlphaSimR and is not passed to MaCS, so MaCS still uses the predefined genetic length. 
For advanced users only.}

\item{nThreads}{if OpenMP is available, this will allow for simulating chromosomes in parallel. 
If the value is NULL, the number of threads is automatically detected.}
}
\value{
an object of \code{\link{MapPop-class}}

Uses the MaCS software to produce founder haplotypes

\details{
There are currently three species histories available: GENERIC, CATTLE, WHEAT, and MAIZE.

The GENERIC history is meant to be a reasonable all-purpose choice. It runs quickly and 
models a population with an effective populations size that has gone through several historic 
bottlenecks. This species history is used as the default arguments in the \code{\link{runMacs2}} 
function, so the user should examine this function for the details of how the species is modeled.

The CATTLE history is based off of real genome sequence data \insertCite{cattle}{AlphaSimR}.

The WHEAT \insertCite{gaynor_2017}{AlphaSimR} and MAIZE \insertCite{hickey_2014}{AlphaSimR} 
histories have been included due to their use in previous simulations. However, it should 
be noted that neither faithfully simulates its respective species. This is apparent by 
the low number of segregating sites simulated by each history relative to their real-world 
analogs. Adjusting these histories to better represent their real-world analogs would result 
in a drastic increase to runtime.

# Creates a populations of 10 outbred individuals
# Their genome consists of 1 chromosome and 100 segregating sites
