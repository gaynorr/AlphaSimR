\arguments{
\item{ratio}{any value greater than 0}

\item{force}{should the check for a running simulation be 
ignored. Only set to TRUE if you know what you are doing.}

\description{
Defines a gender specific recombination ratio. 
The ratio is defined as the amount of recombination in 
females relative to male. Thus, a value of 1 (default) 
specifies equal recombination rates in both males and females. 
A value of 2 specifies twice as much recombination in females 
and a value of 0.5 specifies half as much recombination in 
females.

\section{Usage}{
 SP$setRecRatio(ratio, force = FALSE)
