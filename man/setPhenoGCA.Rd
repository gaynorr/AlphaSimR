\title{Set GCA as phenotype}
\usage{
setPhenoGCA(pop, testers, use = "pheno", varE = NULL, reps = 1, p = 0.5,
  inbred = FALSE, chunkSize = 10000, onlyPheno = FALSE, simParam = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}}}

\item{testers}{an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}}}

\item{use}{true genetic value (\code{gv}) or phenotypes (\code{pheno}, default)}

\item{varE}{error variances for phenotype if \code{use="pheno"}. A vector
of length nTraits for independent error or a square matrix of 
dimensions nTraits for correlated errors.}

\item{reps}{number of replications for phenotype. See details.}

\item{p}{the p-value for the environmental covariate}

\item{inbred}{are both pop and testers fully inbred. They are only 
fully inbred if created by \code{\link{newPop}} using inbred founders 
or by the \code{\link{makeDH}} function}

\item{chunkSize}{when using inbred=TRUE, this 
parameter determines the maximum number of hybrids created 
at one time. Smaller values reduce RAM usage, but may take 
more time.}

\item{onlyPheno}{should only the phenotype be returned, see return}

\item{simParam}{an object of \code{\link{SimParam}}}
}
\value{
Returns an object of \code{\link{Pop-class}} or 
a matrix if onlyPheno=TRUE
}
\description{
Calculates general combining ability from a set of testers and 
returns these values as phenotypes for a population.
}
\details{
The reps parameter is for convient representation of replicated data. 
It was intended for representation of replicated yield trials in plant 
breeding programs. In this case, varE is set to the plot error and 
reps is set to the number plots per entry. The resulting phenotype 
would reflect the mean of all replications.
