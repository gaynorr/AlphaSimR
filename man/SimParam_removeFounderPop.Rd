\title{Switch founder population}
\description{
Switches the founder population in the founderPop 
field. This may be desirable if traits are to be 
tuned to a population derived from the original 
founderPop. Note that no checking is performed to verify 
that the genetic map and/or number of segregating sites 
hasn't changed. The new founderPop can be 
\code{\link{MapPop-class}} or \code{\link{RawPop-class}}

Removes the founder population from the founderPop 
field. This can be ran after all traits have been 
added to reduce the size of the SimParam object.
